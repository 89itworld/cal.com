- Forms
  - A form has it's UI as well as form inputs in DB
  - Form's UI can be provided by Cal.com or the user himself(on his website)
- Routing
  - Routing Logic is taken care of by Cal.com only. It takes Form Data as the input(can be provided directly by customer or filled in Cal.com form) and then it gives a URL to redirect to.
  - Form Data can be available automatically without booker's input as well(e.g. GeoLocation Data, Time of Booking, other user actions that he might have taken in the past and available on website)
